### Creating a Donut
You can create a new donut item by filling out the form on the right-hand side of the page. Enter the name of the donut, the price (as an integer) in dollars, and the kcalories, select if the donut is in stock, and check if the donut is vegan.

Finally, click on 'Create a New Donut' to create your donut. This new donut will appear on the column on the left-hand side of the page.

### Removing a Donut
You can remove a donut by clicking on the 'Remove Donut' button at the bottom of each donut element.

### Changing the In-Stock Detail on the Donut
You can change whether or not a donut is in stock by clicking on the 'In Stock' or 'Out of Stock' element on a donut. A donut that is in stock will change to be out of stock and vice versa.
