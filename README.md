Finally, click on 'Create a New Donut' to create your donut. This new donut will appear on the column on the left-hand side of the page.

### Removing a Donut
You can remove a donut by clicking on the 'Remove Donut' button at the bottom of each donut element.

### Changing the In-Stock Detail on the Donut
You can change whether or not a donut is in stock by clicking on the 'In Stock' or 'Out of Stock' element on a donut. A donut that is in stock will change to be out of stock and vice versa.
